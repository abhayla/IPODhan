/**
 * IPO identity resolution — the SINGLE source of truth for "which row is this?"
 *
 * Extracted (T-307, write-path hardening Phase 1 — see
 * docs/architecture/write-path-hardening.md §1.4 and §2(a) step 1) from
 * data-persister.ts, where three independent hand-copies of this lookup had
 * drifted: the guard (BaseScraperOrchestrator) and the two write paths
 * (data-persister.upsertIPO, DataConsolidationOrchestrator) each carried
 * their own two- or three-tier version, kept "in sync" only by a comment.
 * When T-293 added a fuzzy (typo) tier to the write path only, the guard
 * silently stopped seeing rows the write still hit — protection was skipped
 * on exactly the rows the write updated.
 *
 * This is now the ONLY place the tiered logic exists. Every caller (guard or
 * write) gets the identical resolution, in the identical order. Do not
 * change the order or the fuzzy threshold without updating every caller's
 * shared behaviour — see the plan's B7 correction: there is deliberately no
 * `mode` parameter, because two independently-chosen modes is exactly how
 * this bug reopened.
 *
 * T-318 (IDENT — NULL-safe key-first identity, converged build order step 2
 * per docs/architecture/fable-review-2026-08-24.md §5): natural exchange
 * keys (ISIN, then NSE/BSE symbol) are now tried BEFORE name-based matching.
 * Binding design constraints (T-314C/T-316C findings, carried in this
 * task's contract):
 *   - NULL is NEVER a key value. An absent/empty isin or symbol on either
 *     side must never be treated as a match — Postgres permits many NULLs
 *     in a "unique" column, and 962/962 measured "symbol conflicts" in prod
 *     turned out to be 100% NULL-on-one-side, not genuine disagreements.
 *   - `bse_scrip_code` is a SEPARATE keyspace from the NSE/BSE `symbol`
 *     column and is NEVER cross-compared against it (this resolver does not
 *     query `bseScripCode` at all — see `findBySymbol`'s doc comment).
 *   - 69/303 production rows have NEITHER symbol NOR isin (measured,
 *     T-314C/T-317). Name-based matching stays as the TAIL of the priority
 *     chain specifically so those keyless rows keep resolving — it is not
 *     legacy code to delete, it is the fallback for ~23% of the table.
 *   - A key-tier hit and a name-tier hit that disagree (point to two
 *     DIFFERENT existing rows) MUST NOT be silently resolved either way in
 *     this phase — log a structured `identity_conflict` warning and fall
 *     back to the pre-T-318 name-based result, so no data silently moves
 *     rows. See `resolveIpoRow`'s conflict-detection step below.
