/**
 * IPO Field Plan Repository — pull model, design §2.3 (item 5 slice s3).
 *
 * `ipo_field_plan` records what the pull loop ASKED for, not only what it got.
 * This module owns the two writes that make the plan trustworthy, and both are
 * concurrency problems before they are persistence problems:
 *
 *   1. `claimNextDueField` — hands ONE due row to ONE walker. Two walkers
 *      claiming the same row would each fetch the same document and race each
 *      other's writes, and nothing downstream would ever notice. A
 *      select-then-update cannot prevent that: between the select and the
 *      update both transactions see the row unclaimed. So the claim is ONE
 *      statement whose inner select takes `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` — the
 *      loser's select skips the locked row and returns nothing, so the loser
 *      gets `null` rather than a second copy of the same work.
 *
 *   2. `recordOutcome` — writes an attempt's result back. Two guards:
 *
 *      * **Superseded claim.** A walker that was killed, reclaimed, and then
 *        wakes up must not stamp its stale result over the newer walker's
 *        work. The write is conditional on `claim_token` still matching; when
 *        it does not, NOTHING is written and the caller is told so.
 *
 *      * **Skipped write.** `consolidatedUpsertIPO` returns
 *        `skipped: true, skipReason: 'LOCK_NOT_ACQUIRED'` SILENTLY
 *        (`data-consolidation-orchestrator.ts:137-139`). Design §2.3: "The
 *        plan row is written from the RESULT of the write, never in parallel
 *        with it… a skipped return leaves the row PENDING with `attempts`
 *        untouched." A row marked SUPPLIED against a dropped write is a
 *        false-clean state every downstream check reads as success, and
 *        charging an attempt would burn the field's backoff budget for work
 *        that never happened. Only the claim is released.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT cached, for the same reason as
 * `document-fetch-state-repository.ts`: this table is the walk's memory of
 * what it has already done, and a cached answer would make it redo it. It
 * still extends `BaseRepository` for construction consistency.
 *
 * SCOPE: the repository only. The walk that calls it is item 6; plan-row
 * generation and manifest reconciliation are slices 1/2 and a later slice.
